    <div class="about-paragraph">
      We are a group of 5 friends who are passionate about YouTube.
      Creators was originally a class-project, but we feel like there is a real
      need for this, so that why we are now launching it (Alpha Version for now ðŸ˜‡)
    </div>
    <div class="about-paragraph">
      The main goal of Creators is to enable you to discover hidden gems on YouTube,
      and share your favorites with the community!
    </div>
    <div class="about-paragraph">
      This will hopefully give visibility to small Creators and help you discover what's great
      about YouTube !
    </div>
    <div class="about-paragraph">
      As this is our Alpha Version, we need as much feedback as possible.
      You can send them on twitter, facebook, or via email: alex@rising-creators.com
