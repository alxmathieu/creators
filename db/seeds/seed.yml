      Hasheur is a youtuber specialized in crypto-currency. He's doing reviews of products,
      but also a lot of comments on the market. His explanations are really great for newbies to crypto-currency, and
      he will be a great help to learn the ropes behind the buzz-words 'bitcoin' or 'ethereum'!

      PP World is a French tech journalist, and I'm always checking his reviews before buying any product. He's doing reviews, but also travel vlogs,
      with a Tech focus (all tech objects in Japan, or Samsung specials in Korea for example). He's
      not doing any paid videos, and you can definitely trust his expert eye!

      Jerry and Benjamin form a composer-producer-arranger duet. They met at the jazz school and then joined together the conservatory of Aix-en-Provence. Armed with their hats and their sunglasses, they have been having fun since September 2015 revisiting with a launch pad and an UltraNova synth the sounds of everyday life.
