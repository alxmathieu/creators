      Hasheur is a youtuber specialized in crypto-currency. He's doing reviews of products,
      but also a lot of comments on the market. His explanations are really great for newbies to crypto-currency, and
      he will be a great help to learn the ropes behind the buzz-words 'bitcoin' or 'ethereum'!

        Benjamin is probably one of my greatest YouTube's discovery of 2017! He's *very* talented at story-telling, as
        he has a unique way to laugh and speak. I'm always laughing my head off when I listen to his stories!
        Check him out, you won't be disappointed!

        Simon Puech is a UFO in the French youtube game. He started as a Video-game reviewer/Youtuber interviewer,
        but with a very specific angle. Almost philosophical. He's now broaden his audience,
        and will talk about diverse subjects.

        Le Perave is probably one of the future rock star on Youtube in France.

        PP World is a French tech journalist, and I'm always checking his reviews before buying any product. He's doing reviews, but also travel vlogs,
        with a Tech focus (all tech objects in Japan, or Samsung specials in Korea for example). He's
        not doing any paid videos, and you can definitely trust his expert eye!
